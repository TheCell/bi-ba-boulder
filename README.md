# helpful resources
Generate interface etc. from json: https://app.quicktype.io/

to simulate the database locally I use XAMPP

# The Backend
The Backend is build with PHP, MySQL   
I'm using Symfony for the Backend and Composer to create the Files etc.  
Check out the Readme in the backend folder to set it up

# Setup Fileshare
1. Open an elevated PowerShell
2. ``New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path C:\xampp\htdocs\boulders -Target C:\dev\Git\bi-ba-boulder\fileshare``
3. Now you can download the files with ``http://localhost/boulders/...`` (example ``http://localhost/boulders/bimano/bimano_high.glb``)

# Starting the Devtools
1. start xampp
2. npm start
3. in a second terminal `cd .\backend\symfony-project\` and then `symfony server:start`

# Deployment
The deployment works over Github Actions  
The .htaccess won't be copied you have to do that on your own.
